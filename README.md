# How to Deploy a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application on GKE

Imagine teaching an AI to answer questions about Netflix shows with pinpoint accuracy. That's the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - a technique that supercharges large language models (LLMs) by pairing them with a searchable knowledge base.

In this guide, I'll walk you through deploying a RAG application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) - step-by-step, like a classroom lab. By the end, you'll have a working chat interface powered by mistral-7b and a Netflix dataset. Let's get started!

## What is RAG?

RAG makes LLMs smarter by giving them real-time context from a dataset. Instead of retraining the model (which is costly and slow), RAG uses a vector database to retrieve relevant info - like Netflix show descriptions - and feeds it to the LLM.

**Why it matters:** It's perfect for domain-specific knowledge or fast-changing content.

## Our Setup

- **AI Model:** mistral-7b for answering questions
- **Vector Database:** Cloud SQL with pgvector for storing embeddings
- **Tools:** A Ray cluster, Jupyter notebook, and chat UI - all on GKE

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Gather Your Tools

Before we begin, install the essentials:
- `kubectl`: Control Kubernetes clusters
- `Terraform`: Automate infrastructure setup
- `Helm`: Manage Kubernetes apps
- `gcloud`: Work with Google Cloud

### Step 2: Understand the Architecture

Here's how everything fits together:
- A Jupyter notebook processes the Netflix dataset from Kaggle
- A Ray cluster turns data into vector embeddings and stores them in pgvector
- A chat UI retrieves context, adds it to your question, and sends it to mistral-7b

### Step 3: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

Terraform is our blueprint for spinning up GKE, databases, and networking.

1. **Get the Code:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ai-on-gke.git
   cd ai-on-gke/applications/rag
